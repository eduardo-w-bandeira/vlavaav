        <h2>Meaning</h2>
        <p>In the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of John, Jesus declares, "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35). This means that just as bread is essential for physical sustenance, Jesus is essential for spiritual life. Believing in Him brings eternal life and deep fulfillment that goes beyond earthly needs.</p>
